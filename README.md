# CPSC441-TicTacToe
 

This python program handles the client-side connection to play a game of tictactoe against an script running on a server.
It provides an interface to make the gaming experience smoother. 
It is also capable of creating and loading game saves as a .txt file.
Players can also keep check their statistics during their session by going to the show score section.

TO RUN: go to the directory where the file is located in command line and execute the command "python tictacClient.py 136.159.5.25 6969"

The script that plays the opponent's moves is currently hosted on University of Calgary CPSC servers and can be accessed using the IP Address "136.159.5.25" and port "6969".
In the case the server is no more active, one can download the server files and run on it locally on their own Linux machine. Changing the IP Address and port accordingly will be necessary.
